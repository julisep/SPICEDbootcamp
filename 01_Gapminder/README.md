## Julia's "Week 1 Project" of the SPICED Data Science Bootcamp

Three datasets from the gapminder project on fertility, life expectancy and population per country and year are combined.
The resulting dataset is transformed to serve the specific needs.
Figures are created using pandas.
An animated .gif is created using imageio showing a development of fertility, life expectancy and population over several years.
