Florence and the Machine;100 years;I believe in you and in our hearts we know the truth and I believe in love and the darker it gets, the more I do Try and fill us with your hate and we will shine a light And the days will become endless and never, and never turn to night And never, and never turn to night  Then it's just too much, I cannot get you close enough A hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here And lord, don't let me break this, let me hold you lightly Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly  We have no need to fight We raise our voices and let our hearts take flight Get higher than those planes can fly Where the stars do not take sides  Then it's just too much, I cannot get you close enough A hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here And lord, don't let me break this, let me hold you lightly Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly  And then it's just too much, the streets, they still run with blood A hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here And lord, don't let me break this, let me hold you lightly Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly  I let him sleep, and as he does My held breath fills the room with blood Hurts in ways I can't describe My heart bends and breaks so many, many times And is born again with each sunrise And is born again with each sunrise  Funerals were held all over the city The youth bleed in the square And women raged as old men fumbled and cried We're sorry, we thought you didn't care And how does it feel now you've scratched that itch? How does it feel? Pulled out all your stitches Cuteness is a bitch  A hundred arms, a hundred years A hundred arms, a hundred years  And then it's just too much, the streets, they still run with blood A hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here And lord, don't let me break this, let me hold you lightly Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly, yeah  Oh, oh, oh (hundred, hundred years)

Florence and the Machine;all this and heaven too;And the heart is hard to translate It has a language of it's own It talks in tongues and quiet sighs  And prayers and proclamations in the grand days  Of great men and the smallest of gestures In short shallow gasps  But with all my education I can't seem to commend it And the words are all escaping me And coming back all damaged And I would put them back in poetry If I only knew how, I can't seem to understand it  And I would give all this and heaven too I would give it all if only for a moment That I could just understand  The meaning of the word you see 'Cause I've been scrawling it forever But it never makes sense to me at all  And it talks to me in tiptoes And sings to me inside It cries out in the darkest night And breaks in the morning light  But with all my education I can't seem to commend it And the words are all escaping And coming back all damaged And I would put them back in poetry If I only knew how I can't seem to understand it  And I would give all this and heaven too I would give it all if only for a moment That I could just understand  The meaning of the word you see 'Cause I've been scrawling it forever But it never makes sense to me at all  And I would give all this and heaven too I would give it all if only for a moment That I could just understand  The meaning of the word you see 'Cause I've been scrawling it forever But it never makes sense to me at all  No, words are a language It doesn't deserve such treatment And all my stumbling phrases Never amounted to anything worth this feeling All this heaven never could describe  Such a feeling as I'm healing, words were never so useful So I was screaming out a language  That I never knew existed before
Florence and the Machine;are you hurting the one you love?;Are you hurting the one you love? You say you've found Heaven but you can't find God. Are you hurting the one you love? Bite your tongue till it tastes like blood.  Are you hurting the one you love? So many glasses on the tabletop. Are you hurting the one you love? You'd like to stay in heaven but the rules are too tough.  Tough, It's just too tough. Tough, It's just too tough.  Are you hurting the one you love? When they watched the walls, and the ticking clock. Are you hurting the one you love? And was it something you could not stop.  Could not stop. Stop, Could not stop. Stop, Could not stop. Stop, Could not stop. Stop, Could not stop.  Are you hurting the one you love? When you leave them sleeping on the hollow ground. Are you hurting the one you love? And lost for themselves.  Are you hurting the one you love? And if heaven knows then who will stop. Are you hurting the one you love? You said you got to heaven, but it wasn't enough.
Florence and the Machine;bedroom hymns;This is as good a place to fall as any We'll build our alter here Make me your Maria I'm already on my knees You had Jesus on your breath And I caught him in mine Sweating our confessions The undone and the divine   'Cause this is his body This is his blood Such selfish prayers And I can't get enough  Spilled milk tears, I did this for you Spilling over the idol The black and the blue  The sweetest submission Drinking it in The wine, the women, the bedroom hymns  'Cause this is his body This is his love Such selfish prayers And I can't get enough  'Cause   I'm not here looking for absolution Because I found myself an old solution I'm not here looking for absolution Because I found myself an old solution  This is his body This is his love Such selfish prayers,  I can't get enough  This is his body This is his love Such selfish prayers,  I can't get enough
Florence and the Machine;between two lungs;"Between two lungs it was released The breath that carried me The sigh that blew me forward  'Cause it was trapped Trapped between two lungs It was trapped between two lungs It was trapped between two lungs  And my running feet could fly Each breath screaming ""We are all too young to die""  Between two lungs it was released The breath that passed from you to me That flew between us as we slept That slipped from your mouth into mine It crept between two lungs It was released The breath that passed from you to me That flew between us as we slept That slipped from your mouth into mine It crept  'Cause it was trapped Tapped between two lungs It was trapped between two lungs  Now all the days of begging The days of theft No more gasping for a breath The air has filled me head-to-toe And I can see the ground far below I have this breath And I hold it tight And I keep it in my chest With all my might I pray to God this breath will last As it pushes past my lips As I gasp  Between two lungs it was released The breath that passed from you to me"

Florence and the Machine;bird song;Well I didn't tell anyone, but a bird flew by Saw what I'd done he set up a nest outside, And he sang about what I'd become He sang so loud, sang so clear I was afraid all the neighbours would hear, So I invited him in, just to reason with him I promised I wouldn't do it again  But he sang louder and louder inside the house, And no I couldn't get him out So I trapped him under a cardboard box Stood on it to make him stop I picked up the bird and above the din I said That's the last song you'll ever sing Held him down, broke his neck, Taught him a lesson he wouldn't forget  But in my dreams began to creep That old familiar tweet tweet tweet  I opened my mouth to scream and shout, I waved my arms and flapped about But I couldn't scream and I couldn't shout, Couldn't scream and I couldn't shout  I opened my mouth to scream and shout Waved my arms and flapped about But I couldn't scream I couldn't shout, The song was coming from my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth  From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth  From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth  From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth
Florence and the Machine;blinding;Seems that I have been held, in some dreaming state A tourist in the waking world, never quite awake No kiss, no gentle word could wake me from this slumber Until I realize that it was you who held me under  Felt it in my fist, in my feet, in the hollows of my eyelids Shaking through my skull, through my spine and down through my ribs  No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone No more calling like a crow for a boy, for a body in the garden No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world  And I could hear the thunder and see the lightning crack And all around the world was waking, I never could go back 'Cause all the walls of dreaming, they were torn right open And finally it seemed that the spell was broken  And all my bones began to shake, my eyes flew open And all my bones began to shake, my eyes flew open  No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone No more calling like a crow for a boy, for a body in the garden No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world  Snow white's stitching up the circuit boards Synapse's slipping through the hidden door Snow white's stitching up your circuit board  No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone No more calling like a crow for a boy, for a body in the garden No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world  Snow white's stitching up the circuit boards Synapse's slipping through the hidden door Snow white's stitching up your circuit board Synapse's slipping through the hidden door

Ah-ah, ah-ah I think I'm breaking down again Ah-ah, ah-ah I think I'm breaking down  All alone on the edge of sleep My old familiar friend Comes and lies down next to me And I can see it coming from the edge of the room Smiling in the streetlight even with my eyes shut tight I still see it coming now  Ah-ah, ah-ah I think I'm breaking down again Ah-ah, ah-ah I think I'm breaking down again Ah-ah, ah-ah I think I'm breaking down again Ah-ah, ah-ah I think I'm breaking down
Florence and the Machine;breath of life;Ha oh I was looking for a breath of life A little touch of heavenly light But all the choirs in my head sang no To get a dream of life again A little of vision of the start and the end But all the choirs in my head sang no  But I only needed one more touch Another taste of heavenly rush And I believe, I believe it so And I only needed one more touch Another taste of devouring rush And I believe, I believe it so  Whose side am I on, whose side am I? Whose side am I on, whose side am I?

Florence and the Machine;caught;It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do To try and keep from calling you Well, can my dreams keep coming true How can they, cause when I sleep I never dream of you  As if the dream of you, it sleeps too But it never slips away It just gains its strength and digs its hooks To drag me through the day  And I'm caught I forget all that I've been taught I can't keep calm, I can't keep still Pulled apart against my will  It's the hardest thing I've ever had to prove You turn to salt as I turned around to look at you Old friends have said, the books I've read Say it's the thing to do But it's hard to see it when you're in it Cause I went blind for you  Then you leave my head and crawl out of bed Subconscious [?] And for those hours deep in the dark Perhaps you don't exist  But I'm caught I forget all that I've been taught I can't keep calm, I can't keep still Pulled apart against my will  And I was thrashing on the line Somewhere between Desperate and divine I can't keep calm, I can't keep still Persephone will have her fill  And I'm caught I forget all that I've been taught I can't keep calm, I can't keep still Pulled apart against my will  And I'm caught I forget all that I've been taught I can't keep calm, I can't keep still Pulled apart against my will

But it didn't hurt at all And let it wash away, wash away  And in a moment of joy and fury I threw myself In the balcony like my grandmother so many years before me I've always been in love with you Could you tell it from the moment that I met you?  And we're a family pulled from the flood You tore the floorboards up And let the river rush in Not wash away, wash away  We were reaching in the dark (wash away) That summer in New York (wash away) And was it so far to fall? (wash away) You said it didn't hurt at all And let it wash away, wash away  And Joshua came down from the mountain With a tablet in his hands Told me that he loved me, yeah And then ghosted me again  We were reaching in the dark That summer in New York And it was so far to fall But it didn't hurt at all I let it wash away, wash away Reaching in the dark (wash away) That summer in New York (wash away) And was it so far to fall?
