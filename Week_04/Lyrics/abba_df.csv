the air gets cold Then I think of us  of you and I And it almost makes me cry So sad and kind of bitter sweet And the memories filled with tears And I fear my heart will break Guess it all was my mistake Autumn s chilling winds were blowing through the trees And rain fell softly on your face Oh I remember every little thing about that day I remember every place Grey skies  you were laughing at the clouds And rain fell softly on your face The memories of our time together cannot be replaced I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days Det r cker d r Ja Nu h r jag allts  v ldigt lite frida Free as a bumble bee I m down And I feel depressed Sitting here Just waiting For next bus traveling Down town It s a cry and a shame Isn t it A beautiful weather If I could have my way Well  I would not be working On a day like this I know what I like to be As free As a bumble bee Take a zip of Every flower Free As a bumble bee What a way Each lazy hour What a good life Lying laid back Like an old railroad bum by the track What a good life Living outdoors Lie in the grass and chew on a straw Rubber ball man A poster on the wall Of a dear friend I wish there was a way that I could show you How your songs set me free The hero of them all You re a legend I guess I never get a chance to know you Still you re close as can be Make the band stand To a dream land  rubber ball man Clapping your hands And your feet dance  rubber ball man When you re jumping up and down  nobody s standing still Some of us screaming Some of us dreaming Look at your fans How we love you  rubber ball man Look at your fans How we love you  rubber ball man Look at your fans How we love you  rubber ball man Crying over you I m waiting for you  baby I m sitting all alone I feel so cold without you It chills me to the bone I never thought you d leave me But now I know it s true Oh  lord I m blue I m crying over you I m waiting for you  baby I m sitting all alone I feel so cold without you It chills me to the bone I never thought you d leave me But now I know it s true Oh  lord I m blue I m crying over you Crying over you I m crying over you Crying over Little memories Of things we used to

ABBA;cassandra;Down in the street they re all singing and shouting Staying alive though the city is dead Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter While you are crying alone on your bed Pity Cassandra that no one believed you But then again you were lost from the start Now we must suffer and sell our secrets Bargain  playing smart  aching in our hearts Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood Now the last day is dawning Some of us wanted but none of us would Listen to words of warning But on the darkest of nights Nobody knew how to fight And we were caught in our sleep Sorry Cassandra I didn t believe You really had the power I only saw it as dreams you would weave Until the final hour So in the morning your ship will be sailing Now that your father and sister are gone There is no reason for you to linger You re grieving deeply but still moving on You know the future is casting a shadow No one else sees it but you know your fate Packing your bags  being slow and thorough Knowing  though you re late  that ship is sure to wait Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood Now the last day is dawning Some of us wanted but none of us would Listen to words of warning But on the darkest of nights Nobody knew how to fight And we were caught in our sleep Sorry Cassandra I didn t believe You really had the power I only saw it as dreams you would weave Until the final hour I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain She stood on deck  just a tiny figure Rigid and restrained  blue eyes filled with pain Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood Now the last day is dawning Some of us wanted but none of us would Listen to words of warning But on the darkest of nights Nobody knew how to fight And we were caught in our sleep Sorry Cassandra I didn t believe You really had the power I only saw it as dreams you would weave Until the final hour I m sorry Cassandra I m sorry Cassandra
