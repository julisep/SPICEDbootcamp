Florence and the Machine;100 years;I believe in you and in our hearts we know the truth and I believe in love and the darker it gets  the more I do Try and fill us with your hate and we will shine a light And the days will become endless and never  and never turn to night And never  and never turn to night Then it s just too much  I cannot get you close enough A hundred arms  a hundred years  you can always find me here And lord  don t let me break this  let me hold you lightly Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly We have no need to fight We raise our voices and let our hearts take flight Get higher than those planes can fly Where the stars do not take sides Then it s just too much  I cannot get you close enough A hundred arms  a hundred years  you can always find me here And lord  don t let me break this  let me hold you lightly Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly And then it s just too much  the streets  they still run with blood A hundred arms  a hundred years  you can always find me here And lord  don t let me break this  let me hold you lightly Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly I let him sleep  and as he does My held breath fills the room with blood Hurts in ways I can t describe My heart bends and breaks so many  many times And is born again with each sunrise And is born again with each sunrise Funerals were held all over the city The youth bleed in the square And women raged as old men fumbled and cried We re sorry  we thought you didn t care And how does it feel now you ve scratched that itch How does it feel Pulled out all your stitches Cuteness is a bitch A hundred arms  a hundred years A hundred arms  a hundred years And then it s just too much  the streets  they still run with blood A hundred arms  a hundred years  you can always find me here And lord  don t let me break this  let me hold you lightly Give me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly  yeah Oh  oh  oh  hundred  hundred years

Florence and the Machine;all this and heaven too;And the heart is hard to translate It has a language of it s own It talks in tongues and quiet sighs  And prayers and proclamations in the grand days  Of great men and the smallest of gestures In short shallow gasps But with all my education I can t seem to commend it And the words are all escaping me And coming back all damaged And I would put them back in poetry If I only knew how  I can t seem to understand it And I would give all this and heaven too I would give it all if only for a moment That I could just understand  The meaning of the word you see Cause I ve been scrawling it forever But it never makes sense to me at all And it talks to me in tiptoes And sings to me inside It cries out in the darkest night And breaks in the morning light But with all my education I can t seem to commend it And the words are all escaping And coming back all damaged And I would put them back in poetry If I only knew how I can t seem to understand it And I would give all this and heaven too I would give it all if only for a moment That I could just understand  The meaning of the word you see Cause I ve been scrawling it forever But it never makes sense to me at all And I would give all this and heaven too I would give it all if only for a moment That I could just understand  The meaning of the word you see Cause I ve been scrawling it forever But it never makes sense to me at all No  words are a language It doesn t deserve such treatment And all my stumbling phrases Never amounted to anything worth this feeling All this heaven never could describe  Such a feeling as I m healing  words were never so useful So I was screaming out a language  That I never knew existed before
Florence and the Machine;are you hurting the one you love;Are you hurting the one you love You say you ve found Heaven but you can t find God Are you hurting the one you love Bite your tongue till it tastes like blood Are you hurting the one you love So many glasses on the tabletop Are you hurting the one you love You d like to stay in heaven but the rules are too tough Tough It s just too tough Tough It s just too tough Are you hurting the one you love When they watched the walls  and the ticking clock Are you hurting the one you love And was it something you could not stop Could not stop Stop Could not stop Stop Could not stop Stop Could not stop Stop Could not stop Are you hurting the one you love When you leave them sleeping on the hollow ground Are you hurting the one you love And lost for themselves Are you hurting the one you love And if heaven knows then who will stop Are you hurting the one you love You said you got to heaven  but it wasn t enough 
Florence and the Machine;bedroom hymns;This is as good a place to fall as any We ll build our alter here Make me your Maria I m already on my knees You had Jesus on your breath And I caught him in mine Sweating our confessions The undone and the divine  Cause this is his body This is his blood Such selfish prayers And I can t get enough Spilled milk tears I did this for you Spilling over the idol The black and the blue The sweetest submission Drinking it in The wine  the women  the bedroom hymns Cause this is his body This is his love Such selfish prayers And I can t get enough Cause  I m not here looking for absolution Because I found myself an old solution I m not here looking for absolution Because I found myself an old solution This is his body This is his love Such selfish prayers   I can t get enough This is his body This is his love Such selfish prayers   I can t get enough
Florence and the Machine;between two lungs;Between two lungs it was released The breath that carried me The sigh that blew me forward Cause it was trapped Trapped between two lungs It was trapped between two lungs It was trapped between two lungs And my running feet could fly Each breath screaming We are all too young to die Between two lungs it was released The breath that passed from you to me That flew between us as we slept That slipped from your mouth into mine It crept between two lungs It was released The breath that passed from you to me That flew between us as we slept That slipped from your mouth into mine It crept Cause it was trapped Tapped between two lungs It was trapped between two lungs Now all the days of begging The days of theft No more gasping for a breath The air has filled me head to toe And I can see the ground far below I have this breath And I hold it tight And I keep it in my chest With all my might I pray to God this breath will last As it pushes past my lips As I gasp Between two lungs it was released The breath that passed from you to me
Florence and the Machine;big god;You need a big god Big enough to hold your love You need a big god Big enough to fill you up You keep me up at night To my messages  you do not reply You know I still like you the most The best of the best and the worst of the worst Well  you can never know The places that I go I still like you the most You ll always be my favorite ghost You need a big god Big enough to hold your love You need a big god Big enough to fill you up Sometimes I think it s gettin  better And then it gets much worse Is it just part of the process Well  Jesus Christ  it hurts Though I know I should know better Well  I can make this work Is it just part of the process Well  Jesus Christ  Jesus Christ  it hurts Jesus Christ  Jesus Christ  it hurts You need a big god Big enough to hold your love You need a big god Big enough to fill you up Shower your affection  let it rain on me And pull down the mountain  drag your cities to the sea  yeah Shower your affection  let it rain on me Don t leave me on this white cliff Let it slide down to the  slide down to the sea Slide down to the  slide down to the sea
Florence and the Machine;bird song;Well I didn t tell anyone  but a bird flew by Saw what I d done he set up a nest outside And he sang about what I d become He sang so loud  sang so clear I was afraid all the neighbours would hear So I invited him in  just to reason with him I promised I wouldn t do it again But he sang louder and louder inside the house And no I couldn t get him out So I trapped him under a cardboard box Stood on it to make him stop I picked up the bird and above the din I said That s the last song you ll ever sing Held him down  broke his neck Taught him a lesson he wouldn t forget But in my dreams began to creep That old familiar tweet tweet tweet I opened my mouth to scream and shout I waved my arms and flapped about But I couldn t scream and I couldn t shout Couldn t scream and I couldn t shout I opened my mouth to scream and shout Waved my arms and flapped about But I couldn t scream I couldn t shout The song was coming from my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth From my mouth
Florence and the Machine;blinding;Seems that I have been held  in some dreaming state A tourist in the waking world  never quite awake No kiss  no gentle word could wake me from this slumber Until I realize that it was you who held me under Felt it in my fist  in my feet  in the hollows of my eyelids Shaking through my skull  through my spine and down through my ribs No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone No more calling like a crow for a boy  for a body in the garden No more dreaming like a girl so in love  so in love No more dreaming like a girl so in love  so in love No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world And I could hear the thunder and see the lightning crack And all around the world was waking  I never could go back Cause all the walls of dreaming  they were torn right open And finally it seemed that the spell was broken And all my bones began to shake  my eyes flew open And all my bones began to shake  my eyes flew open No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone No more calling like a crow for a boy  for a body in the garden No more dreaming like a girl so in love  so in love No more dreaming like a girl so in love  so in love No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world Snow white s stitching up the circuit boards Synapse s slipping through the hidden door Snow white s stitching up your circuit board No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone No more calling like a crow for a boy  for a body in the garden No more dreaming like a girl so in love  so in love No more dreaming like a girl so in love  so in love No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world Snow white s stitching up the circuit boards Synapse s slipping through the hidden door Snow white s stitching up your circuit board Synapse s slipping through the hidden door
Florence and the Machine;breaking down;All alone it was always there you see And even on my own It was always standing next to me I can see it coming from the edge of the room Creeping in the streetlight holding my hand in the pale gloom Can you see it coming now Ah ah  ah ah I think I m breaking down again Ah ah  ah ah I think I m breaking down All alone even when I was a child I ve always known there was something to be frightened of I can see it coming from the edge of the room Creeping in the streetlight holding my hand in the pale gloom Can you see it coming now Ah ah  ah ah I think I m breaking down again Ah ah  ah ah I think I m breaking down All alone on the edge of sleep My old familiar friend Comes and lies down next to me And I can see it coming from the edge of the room Smiling in the streetlight even with my eyes shut tight I still see it coming now Ah ah  ah ah I think I m breaking down again Ah ah  ah ah I think I m breaking down again Ah ah  ah ah I think I m breaking down again Ah ah  ah ah I think I m breaking down
Florence and the Machine;breath of life;Ha oh I was looking for a breath of life A little touch of heavenly light But all the choirs in my head sang no To get a dream of life again A little of vision of the start and the end But all the choirs in my head sang no But I only needed one more touch Another taste of heavenly rush And I believe  I believe it so And I only needed one more touch Another taste of devouring rush And I believe  I believe it so Whose side am I on  whose side am I Whose side am I on  whose side am I And the fever began to spread From my heart down to my legs But the room was so quiet oh And although I wasn t losing my mind It was a chorus so sublime But the room is too quiet  oh  the fever I was looking for a breath of life A little touch of heavenly light But all the choirs in my head sang no  I believe it To get a dream of life again A little vision of the start and the end But all the choirs in my head sang no Ha oh Ha oh It s a harder way And it s come to claim her And I always say We should be together I can see below Cause there s something in here And if you are gone I will not belong here And I started to hear it again But this time it wasn t the end And the room was so quiet  oh And my heart is a hollow plain For the devil to dance again And the room was too quiet  oh I was looking for a breath of life A little touch of heavenly light But all the choirs in my head sang no
Florence and the Machine;caught;It s the hardest thing I ve ever had to do To try and keep from calling you Well  can my dreams keep coming true How can they  cause when I sleep I never dream of you As if the dream of you  it sleeps too But it never slips away It just gains its strength and digs its hooks To drag me through the day And I m caught I forget all that I ve been taught I can t keep calm  I can t keep still Pulled apart against my will It s the hardest thing I ve ever had to prove You turn to salt as I turned around to look at you Old friends have said  the books I ve read Say it s the thing to do But it s hard to see it when you re in it Cause I went blind for you Then you leave my head and crawl out of bed Subconscious  And for those hours deep in the dark Perhaps you don t exist But I m caught I forget all that I ve been taught I can t keep calm  I can t keep still Pulled apart against my will And I was thrashing on the line Somewhere between Desperate and divine I can t keep calm  I can t keep still Persephone will have her fill And I m caught I forget all that I ve been taught I can t keep calm  I can t keep still Pulled apart against my will And I m caught I forget all that I ve been taught I can t keep calm  I can t keep still Pulled apart against my will

Florence and the Machine;dog days are over;Happiness  hit her like a train on a track Coming towards her  stuck still no turning back She hid around corners and she hid under beds She killed it with kisses and from it she fled With every bubble she sank with a drink And washed it away down the kitchen sink The dog days are over The dog days are done The horses are coming so you better run Run fast for your mother run fast for your father Run for your children for your sisters and brothers Leave all your love and your longing behind you Can t carry it with you if you want to survive The dog days are over The dog days are done Can t you hear the horses Cause here they come And I never wanted anything from you Except everything you had And what was left after that too  oh Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back Struck from a great height By someone who should know better than that The dog days are over The dog days are done Can you hear the horses Cause here they come Run fast for your mother and fast for your father Run for your children for your sisters and brothers Leave all your love and your loving behind you Can t carry it with you if you want to survive The dog days are over The dog days are done Can you hear the horses Cause here they come The dog days are over The dog days are done Can you hear the horses Cause here they come The dog days are over The dog days are done The horses are coming So you better run

Queen;going back;I think I m going back  To the things I learnt so well in my youth  I think I m returning to  Those days when I was young enough to know the truth  Now  there are no games  To only pass the time  No more colouring books  No Christmas bells to chime  But thinking young and growing older is no sin  And I can t play the game of life to win  I can recall a time  When I wasn t ashamed to reach out to a friend  And  now  I think I ve got  A lot more than just my toys to lend  Now there s more to do  Than watch my sailboat glide  And every day can be  My magic carpet ride  And I can play hide and seek with my fears  And live my days instead of counting my years  Then everyone debates  The true reality  I d rather see the world  The way it used to be  A little bit of freedom s all we lack  So catch me if you can  I m going back

Queen;introduction;Wilson  Wilson Wilson  Wilson Wilson Once upon a time there was a mountain That rose out of a vast green forest And in the forest there were birds And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers The forest was also inhabited By a small group of people called the lizards The lizards were a simple people And they had lived in the forest undisturbed For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility Once a year when spring came And the first blossoms began to show The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain To give thanks for all that they had They thanked the birds And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks And the trees and the rivers But most importantly  they thanked Icculus Icculus lived at the top of the mountain Or at least everyone thought so For no one had actually ever seen him But they knew he existed Because they had the Helping Friendly Book Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift It contained all of the knowledge Inherent in the universe And had enabled the Lizards To exist in harmony with nature for years And so they lived Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge His name was Wilson And he quickly became intrigued By the Lizards way of life He asked if he could stay on And live in the forest And the Lizards  who had never seen an outsider Were happy to oblige Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book And all was well Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone Wilson explained that he had hidden the book Knowing that the Lizards had become Dependent on it for survival He declared himself king And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge He cut down the trees and built a city Which he called Prussia And in the center of the city He built a castle And locked in the highest tower of the castle
