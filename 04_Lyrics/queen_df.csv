Queen;39;In the year of  39 assembled here the volunteers In the days when lands were few Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn The sweetest sight ever seen And the night followed day And the story tellers say That the score brave souls inside For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas Ne er looked back  never feared  never cried Don t you hear my call though you re many years away Don t you hear me calling you Write your letters in the sand For the day I take your hand In the land that our grandchildren knew In the year of  39 came a ship in from the blue The volunteers came home that day And they bring good news of a world so newly born Though their hearts so heavily weigh For the earth is old and grey  little darling  we ll away But my love this cannot be For so many years have gone though I m older but a year Your mother s eyes  from your eyes  cry to me Don t you hear my call though you re many years away Don t you hear me calling you Write your letters in the sand for the day I take your hand In the land that our grandchildren knew Don t you hear my call though you re many years away Don t you hear me calling you All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand For my life Still ahead Pity me

Queen;going back;I think I m going back  To the things I learnt so well in my youth  I think I m returning to  Those days when I was young enough to know the truth  Now  there are no games  To only pass the time  No more colouring books  No Christmas bells to chime  But thinking young and growing older is no sin  And I can t play the game of life to win  I can recall a time  When I wasn t ashamed to reach out to a friend  And  now  I think I ve got  A lot more than just my toys to lend  Now there s more to do  Than watch my sailboat glide  And every day can be  My magic carpet ride  And I can play hide and seek with my fears  And live my days instead of counting my years  Then everyone debates  The true reality  I d rather see the world  The way it used to be  A little bit of freedom s all we lack  So catch me if you can  I m going back

Queen;introduction;Wilson  Wilson Wilson  Wilson Wilson Once upon a time there was a mountain That rose out of a vast green forest And in the forest there were birds And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers The forest was also inhabited By a small group of people called the lizards The lizards were a simple people And they had lived in the forest undisturbed For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility Once a year when spring came And the first blossoms began to show The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain To give thanks for all that they had They thanked the birds And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks And the trees and the rivers But most importantly  they thanked Icculus Icculus lived at the top of the mountain Or at least everyone thought so For no one had actually ever seen him But they knew he existed Because they had the Helping Friendly Book Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift It contained all of the knowledge Inherent in the universe And had enabled the Lizards To exist in harmony with nature for years And so they lived Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge His name was Wilson And he quickly became intrigued By the Lizards way of life He asked if he could stay on And live in the forest And the Lizards  who had never seen an outsider Were happy to oblige Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book And all was well Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone Wilson explained that he had hidden the book Knowing that the Lizards had become Dependent on it for survival He declared himself king And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge He cut down the trees and built a city Which he called Prussia And in the center of the city He built a castle And locked in the highest tower of the castle
